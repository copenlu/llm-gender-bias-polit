Code and data for the PLOS One paper "Quantifying Gender Bias Towards Politicians in Cross-Lingual Language Models".

We're tidying the code and are hoping to put it up as soon as possible.

If you want access to the code beforehand, feel free to [reach out](mailto:ks@di.ku.dk) and we'll be happy to provide it before then.
